 I no longer work with OS X (or own a Mac device) so this project is in hiatus for an indefinite period of time, sorry!
 Especially considering this needs to be rewritten in Swift.

The MTA Launcher for OS X
=========================

MTA Launcher allows you to run [Multi Theft Auto: San Andreas](http://mtasa.com) on your OS X computer.
To download the latest stable version, please visit the release tab (if there are any releases).

Please note:
* This has been tested using OS X Mavericks (10.9.2) - you should have Mavericks (it's free!)
* This project was created and is currently being built using Xcode Version 5.1.1 (5B1008)
